# üó£Ô∏è Social Network MEAN
This application is a social network developed with MEAN Stack (MongoDB, Express, AngularJs and Node.js). Allows to follow people¬¥s publications, which can include photos. Also it implements one message panel to send private messages to users, and also a global chat to talk in a public way.

### Backend
Developed in NodeJS, an API Rest that attend requests from the web version of the frontend.

### Frontend
Developed in AngularJS, the main components are:

#### Login / Register
Two main options at the right-top side of the app, where you can register yourself and login as well. In case of password forgotten, the login component allows to follow a link for password reset: First an email is sent to the email address of the user with a token. This token is used to reset the user¬¥s password in the next step (this token is set to be valid only for 60 minutes).

#### Account
Its possible to update user data at any time, including the profile photo.

#### Timeline
The publications of the people followed by the user is shown. Also at the right side of the page the "user panel" sidebar is displayed.

#### People
The list of people registered at the app. A button for follow or unfollow is enabled. Again, the current user panel is displayed.

### Profile
By clicking the name of an user or entering the own name, the profile page is shown. All publications and stats of the user are displayed.

#### Messages
Shows a panel with the messages sent and received by the user. It¬¥s possible to send messages only to people who is already following the current user.

#### Chat
This global chat connects everybody together for chatting in a public way.
